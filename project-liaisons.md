# Project Liaisons

The [CCC Project Progression Policy](project-progression-policy.md) explains
that each project accepted by the CCC will be assigned a Technical Advisory
Council (TAC) representative that will serve as a sponsor to champion the
project and provide guidance as needed.

## Responsibilities

Responsibilities of the liaison include:

1. Assist the project in creating a [growth plan](growth-plans.md).

2. Help the project determine what needs to be reviewed by the TAC as
   part of the [annual review process](project-progression-policy.md#iv-annual-review-process).

3. Proactively inform the TAC when something changes that affects the
   project's submission template (changing a License, security reporting
   process, CoC, etc.), rather than waiting for the next annual review.
   
4. Work with the Outreach Committee to develop the spreadsheet which includes
   any upcoming events where CCC projects are giving presentations. Report
   that information back to the TAC at their meetings.

5. In order to be a coach to the project maintainers, be familiar with open
   source best practices for diversity and inclusion.  In particular be
   familiar with 
   [diversity and inclusion policies](diversity-and-inclusion-policies.md)
   and make sure maintainers are aware of its recommendations.
