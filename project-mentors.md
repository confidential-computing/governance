# Project Mentors

The [CCC Project Progression Policy](project-progression-policy.md) explains
that each project accepted by the CCC will be assigned a Technical Advisory
Council (TAC) representative that will serve as a sponsor to champion the
project and provide mentorship as needed.

## Responsibilities

Responsibilities of the mentor include:

1. Assist the project in creating a [growth plan](growth-plans.md), which is required for a
   project in the [Incubation Stage](project-progression-policy.md#incubation-stage).

2. Help the project determine what needs to be reviewed by the TAC as
   part of the [annual review process](project-progression-policy.md#iv-annual-review-process).

3. Proactively inform the TAC when something changes that affects the
   project's submission template (changing a License, security reporting
   process, CoC, etc.), rather than waiting for the next annual review.
