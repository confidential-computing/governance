4.  **Code of conduct**

    1.  Stephano will create a distribution list which will be closed to
        voting board members (<conduct@confidentialcomputing.io>) for
        now, and will likely be changed in the future.

    2.  The code of conduct will be updated via pull requests on GitHub.
        TAC will head up those changes.

    3.  The TAC is advised to recommend projects use the Contributor
        Covenant 2.0, and if they want to use another code of conduct,
        they should provide that document and highlight the differences.
        This will be proposed to the board next meeting to vote on.

    4.  As projects receive code of conduct complaints, they should
        notify the reflector so that the CCC can stay informed of these
        issues. This will also be brought up in the next governing board
        meeting for a vote.

    5.  The suggestion was made that we start all our meetings with a
        Code of Conduct disclaimer. Stephen will research that and get
        back to the board.

    6.  Current Code of Conduct Complaints

        1.  A complaint was raised on one of the CCC project's
            repository. This essentially bled over onto a CCC repository
            (governance). The initial complaint with regards to the
            project has be addressed by the TAC and the project
            leadership.

        2.  The TAC GitHub repository where the complaint was logged
            requires that we address this issue formally as the CCC
            board. We will call an executive session of the governing
            board on Wednesday the 18^th^ at 8:00am PST. This will be
            voting members as well as the TAC chair (Dave) and the Linux
            Foundation Program Manager (Stephano).

5.  **User Engagement Subcommittee**

    1.  Discussions with JPMC have been a very valuable part of adding
        color to our decisions and speaking to their specific industry
        and communities. This is an example of how user engagement can
        be of value.

    2.  Stephen will be having a discussion with the Linux Foundation
        directly regarding these ideas.

    3.  We want to minimize the barriers to joining this group is key as
        we want this to be a strong end user committee.

    4.  Ron and Seth have volunteered to help form this committee.

    5.  Dave will put this on the agenda for next week's TAC to see if
        folks would like to volunteer as members.
