    a.  The board approves the minutes of the Nov 21, 2019 meeting.

    b.  The Outreach Committee is working on documenting talking points
        and a general "elevator pitch" for the CCC in order to frame
        conversations with perspective projects, members, and academic
        institutions. As those documents are available member companies
        will begin outreach activities to academic institutions. We are
        in early conversations with UC Berkley.

    c.  Project progression document is available. More documents will
        be forthcoming.

        works. Scott is working with folks from Intel.

    e.  We are working on where our next F2F can happen.
        [SCaLE](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/18x) and
        [RSA](https://www.rsaconference.com/usa) are possibilities.

    f.  We would like to improve communication with the other groups. In
        order to accomplish this, we will keep this mailing list open to
        all subscribers and the general public (moderated) to post. The
        list membership, however, will remain only Premium Member
        representatives so that private conversations can take place.

    g.  We will move forward next month with forming a Legal Committee.

3.  **Action Items**

    a.  \[Stephano\] Open the list up to non-subscriber, moderated
        posts. Ensure the members of this group are Premium Members, TAC
        chair, Outreach Chair, and General Members rep.

    b.  \[Stephano\] Send out an email to the board requesting legal
        representatives from each of the Premium Member organizations.
        Work with Scott to setup a meeting sometime after January 20.

**Meeting adjourned at 7:32 am PST on December 19, 2019. The next
conference call is scheduled for January 16.**

**Respectfully submitted by Stephano Cetola, Acting Secretary, on
December 19, 2019.**
