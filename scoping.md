# Confidential Computing Consortium Scope

## Executive Summary

* The scope of the Confidential Computing Consortium (CCC) is to
  "promote the widespread use of hardware-based, attested trusted execution
  environments".

* The CCC uses, and recommends the rest of the industry also use, the
  definition: "Confidential Computing is the protection of data
  in use by performing computation in a hardware-based, attested Trusted
  Execution Environment."

* For both the scope of the CCC, and the definition of confidential
  computing, the following terms are to be avoided
  in ways that imply constraints, as being technically problematic:
  "cloud", "main processor", and "encrypted"/"encryption".

* Similarly, any language implying that
  "protecting data in use" is synonymous with "confidential computing"
  is also to be avoided,
  as the latter is only a subset of technologies for the former.

## 1. Related Terminology

The CCC's Technical Advisory Council (TAC) conducted a survey of various terms in the industry related to
protecting data in use, and
composed the following Venn diagram of technologies:

![Figure 1: Related Terminology](related-terminology.png)

Definitions of the various terms in the diagrams can be found in
[Appendix A](#markdown-header-appendix-a-related-terminology).

The solid blue lines indicate that the area is clearly in scope
for CCC discussion and projects. The dotted blue lines indicate that
other areas would not normally fall under the CCC's definition
of Confidential Computing, and would be in scope of the CCC only
if a project in the area could be argued to "promote the widespread use of"
Confidential Computing.  For example, a library that performed
encryption/decryption inside a hardware-based TEE, for use with
Homomorphic Encryption, would be relevant to the CCC.

Unfortunately, several of
the terms used in the diagram have multiple competing definitions.
For example, "privacy-preserving computation" is variously defined as
being (a) synonymous with multi-party computation, or (b) covering
both multi-party computation and homomorphic encryption, or even
(c) covering the entire space of protecting data in use.

There are other relevant standards bodies operating in the overall space,
as depicted in the following diagram:

![Figure 2: Related Organizations](related-organizations.png)

These organizations include:
* [HomomorphicEncryption.org](https://homomorphicencryption.org/)
* [Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Trusted Execution Provisioning WG](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/teep/about/)
* [Trusted Computing Group](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/)
* [GlobalPlatform](https://globalplatform.org/)

In addition to those shown in the diagram:
* ISO/IEC JTC1/SC27 is now
doing work ([N 20273](https://standardsdevelopment.bsigroup.com/projects/9020-03692)) 
on multiparty computation and may expand to other areas, and the ITU has 
published the
[UN Handbook on Privacy-Preserving Computation Techniques](http://publications.officialstatistics.org/handbooks/privacy-preserving-techniques-handbook/UN%20Handbook%20for%20Privacy-Preserving%20Techniques.pdf)
that covers the entire space of the diagram, even though it has
"privacy-preserving computation" in the title.  While the ISO
work is based on member states, the ITU work has a multistakeholder model.
* [TrustedFirmware.org](https://www.trustedfirmware.org/) is another
consortium with related open-source projects, including projects for Arm
trusted firmware, OP-TEE (a lightweight TEE OS), and mbedTLS.
* [FIDO Alliance](https://fidoalliance.org/) develops strong user
authentication standards leveraging some Trusted Execution Environments
(TPMs, embedded Secure Elements, etc.).

Based on the CCC scoping, various relationships (e.g., liaisons) might
be appropriate in the future.
(Most of the organizations listed are not legal entities hosting open
source projects, but do publish relevant specifications.)

## 2. Fine-Grained Axes

In discussing Trusted Execution Environments,
the TAC started by creating a rough taxonomy
of five roughly orthogonal axes, each with a spectrum of narrow-to-broad
options:

1. Hardware/software only or also algorithmic (mathematical)? The CCC
   focus is on promoting the hardware/software end,
   which excludes purely algorithmic technologies
   such as homomorphic encryption and multiparty computation.

2. Hardware-based (+firmware?) required or also software-only? The CCC
   position is that only hardware-rooted technologies can provide
   the desired level of security, in particular for attestation.
   Software only projects can be considered by the CCC if they demonstrably
   "promote" the use of hardware-backed solutions.  (For example,
   a development-time-only emulation technology meant to speed development
   of hardware-backed solutions.)

3. Generalized (fully programmable) only, or also configurable
   (semi-programmable) and even specialized (fixed-purpose, non-programmable)
   also?  The CCC focus is on programmability, but it has not explicitly
   ruled out future submissions on other solutions.

4. On-main CPU only, or also separate processors also?  The CCC
   encompasses the entire spectrum here.

5. Cloud only, or also on-premises (including IoT) also?  The CCC
   encompasses the entire spectrum here.

The TAC also discussed that other attributes (e.g., TCB size) are also
important security evaluation criteria for any given solution or project,
but by themselves weren't considered to be part of the scoping definition per se.

The following table shows how various example technologies fall into the 
above axes, to help illustrate how answers would affect what sorts of 
projects might be accepted or rejected as a result:

## 3. Confidential Computing Definitions

Prior to the CCC definition, there were various competing definitions of
"confidential computing"
including (possibly among others):

* **Gartner report 2019 definition**: Confidential computing is the combination of 
  CPU-based hardware technology and infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
  **cloud** provider virtual machine (VM) images and software tools that 
  enable cloud-using organizations to create completely isolated
  **trusted execution environments (TEE), also called enclaves**. Because
  they offer a form of **encryption** of data in use, these enclaves
  render sensitive information invisible to host OSs and cloud providers.

The TAC observed the following issues with the above definition:

1. It is constrained to only cloud, whereas the TAC consensus is that
   a broader scope is needed, even for projects already in the CCC.

2. The term "encryption" is problematic since some TEEs of interest
   may have other forms of protecting data in use, encryption is just
   one example mechanism.  That is, encryption is a specific mechanism
   rather than a property we are seeking.  You can provide confidentiality
   by access control (for example) and not actually require encryption.

* **[CCC press release](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/uncategorized/2019/10/confidential-computing-consortium-establishes-formation-with-founding-members-and-open-governance-structure/)**: Established in 2019, the Confidential
  Computing Consortium brings together hardware vendors, cloud providers,
  developers, open source experts and academics to accelerate the
  confidential computing market; influence technical and regulatory
  standards; build open source tools that provide the right environment
  for **TEE** development' and host industry outreach and education
  initiatives. Its aims to address **computational trust and security
  for data in use, enabling encrypted data to be processed in memory
  without exposing it to the rest of the system**, reducing exposure
  to sensitive data and providing greater control and transparency for users.

The TAC observed the following issues with the above text:

1. The use of "encrypted" is again seen as problematic.

2. The text is ambiguous about the scope, as the text about
   tools is constrained to "TEE" development, but the aims are broader,
   applying to protecting "data in use", where all of Figure 1 would
   claim to be about protecting data in use.

* **[Mark Russinovich blog](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-azure-confidential-computing/)**: Put simply, confidential computing 
  offers a protection that to date has been missing from public clouds, 
  **encryption of data while in use**. ...
  Confidential computing ensures that when data is "in the clear," which
  is required for efficient processing, the data is protected inside a
  Trusted Execution Environment (TEE - also known as an enclave), an
  example of which is shown in the figure below. TEEs ensure there is
  no way to view data or the operations inside from the outside, even
  with a debugger. They even ensure that only authorized code is permitted
  to access data. If the code is altered or tampered, the operations
  are denied and the environment disabled. The TEE enforces these
  protections throughout the execution of code within it.

The use of "encrypted" was again seen as problematic.  Also the definition
is similarly ambiguous in that "data while in use" is broad (all of Figure 1)
but then the discussion only mentions TEEs.  (A request to Mark for
clarification resulted in him answering that he did not intend the definition
to be limited to TEEs.)

* **[TechTarget definition](https://searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com/definition/confidential-computing)**: Confidential computing is a concept in 
  which **encrypted** data can be processed in memory to limit access to
  ensure **data in use is protected**. Confidential computing is a concept
  promoted by the Confidential Computing Consortium, which is a group of
  organizations that wants to build **tools supporting the protection of
  data**. This concept is especially suitable for public clouds. 

The use of "encrypted" was again seen as problematic.  However, the rest of
the definition is clearly broadly scoped to protecting data in use (not
phrased to be limited to TEEs), and the article goes on to discuss the CCC
after the above definition.

The TAC iterated on several proposals for wording around the scope of
what projects the TAC would recommend as being in scope of the CCC.
The following wording obtained rough consensus:

* "promote the widespread use of hardware-based, attested trusted execution environments".

This proposal puts the focus on hardware-based, attested TEEs, while providing
some leeway with the use of "promote" to allow for non-hardware based
projects that demonstrably promote the use of hardware-based, attested TEEs.

Similarly, the TAC iterated on several proposals for wording around
the definition of the term "confidential computing".  The following
wording obtained consensus and was subsequently adopted by the CCC
Governing Board:

* **CCC Definition**: "Confidential Computing is the protection of data in use by performing
  computation in a hardware-based, attested Trusted Execution Environment."

Subsequent to the adoption of the above definition by the Confidential
Computing Consortium, Gartner's [Hype Cycle for Compute Infrastructure, 2020]
(https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3987268/hype-cycle-for-compute-infrastructure-2020)
now includes the revised definition, which is consistent with the CCC's:
* **Gartner 2020 Definition**: "Confidential computing is a security mechanism that executes code in a
hardware-based trusted execution environment (TEE), also called an enclave. Enclaves
isolate and protect code and data from the host system (plus the host system’s owners)
and may also provide code integrity and attestation."

## Appendix A. Related Terminology

### A.1. Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)

There are many competing definitions of what a "TEE" is, many of which are
listed below:

* **[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_execution_environment)**:
  A secure area of a **main** processor. It guarantees code and data loaded
  inside to be protected with respect to confidentiality and integrity. A
  TEE as an isolated execution environment provides security features such
  as isolated execution, integrity of applications executing with the TEE,
  along with confidentiality of their assets.

As noted earlier, the TAC dislikes the above definition because of its
constraint to a "main" processor.

* **[ARM website](https://blog.quarkslab.com/introduction-to-trusted-execution-environment-arms-trustzone.html)**: a secure area inside a **main**
  processor. It runs in **parallel of the operating system**, in an
  isolated environment. It guarantees that the code and data loaded in
  the TEE are protected with respect to confidentiality and integrity. 

Besides the "main" processor issue, another problem the TAC saw with the
above definition is that it assumes there exists a regular operating system
on the same processor.  In some environments (MCUs, FPGAs, etc.), that is
not necessarily the case.

* **GlobalPlatform**: A device that conforms to specifications from GP's
  [TEE Committee](https://globalplatform.org/technical-committees/trusted-execution-environment-tee-committee/).

The above definition excludes various TEEs (including Intel SGX) from its
definition, which the TAC finds problematic.

* **Mike Bursell's strawman**: A hardware-based technique for securing
  sensitive data and algorithms in such a way that even the kernel,
  root user or hypervisor can't see what's going on

The above definition is narrowly scoped to only hardware-based TEEs,
and thus excludes the items in [Section A.1.1](#markdown-header-a-1-1-software-tee).

One relatively minor issue as worded is that it implies that the TEE has
a kernel, root user, or hypervisor, which may or may not be the case.

* **[IETF TEEP WG](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-teep-architecture)**:
  An environment that enforces that any code within that environment cannot
  be tampered with, and that any data used by such code cannot be read 
  or tampered with by any code outside that environment.

Thie above definition is broader, includes language similar to the broader
text in the Mark Russinovich blog, and has no immediate flaws that the TAC
found.  Some individuals might like to see additional constraints
added to it, but there is no consensus on such gaps and so the above
definition is accepted by both the IETF and the CCC TAC.
(Full disclosure: the TAC chair is also a co-editor of the IETF document
with the above definition.)

#### A.1.1. Software TEE

There are multiple products and solutions today that are software-based and
use the term "TEE", ranging from ones meant for production use, to ones
meant just for development of code to be later used on hardware TEEs.

As one example:

* **[QEMU](https://github.com/qemu/QEMU)**: very widely used open source machine emulator. ... Developers can use 
  the QEMU security extensions that emulate a given TEE to develop and work with Trusted
  Execution Environments (TEEs) that are likely to be the primary consumers
  of the added functionality.

### A.2. Privacy-Preserving Computation

* **[multi-party computation (MPC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-party_computation)**, or **privacy-preserving computation**: a subfield of
  cryptography with the goal of creating methods for parties to jointly
  compute a function over their inputs while keeping those inputs private.
  Unlike traditional cryptographic tasks, where cryptography assures
  security and integrity of communication or storage and the adversary
  is outside the system of participants (an eavesdropper on the sender
  and receiver), the cryptography in this model protects participants'
  privacy from each other.

* **[Homomorphic encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption)**: a form of encryption that allows computation on ciphertexts,
  generating an encrypted result which, when decrypted, matches the
  result of the operations as if they had been performed on the plaintext.
  Homomorphic encryption can be used for **privacy-preserving** outsourced
  storage and **computation**. This allows data to be encrypted and
  out-sourced to commercial cloud environments for processing, all while
  encrypted.

Other sources discussing the relationship among these terms, that were
instrumental in constructing Figure 1, include:

* https://baffle.io/blog/homomorphic-and-multiparty-computation/

* https://medium.com/@PlatON_Network/privacy-preserving-computation-secure-multi-party-computation-i-5b09a20053ce

### A.3. Other Terms

* **[secure cryptoprocessor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_cryptoprocessor)**: a dedicated computer-on-a-chip or microprocessor for carrying out
  cryptographic operations, embedded in a packaging with multiple physical
  security measures, which give it a degree of tamper resistance. Unlike
  cryptographic processors that output decrypted data onto a bus in a
  secure environment, a secure cryptoprocessor does not output decrypted
  data or decrypted program instructions in an environment where security
  cannot always be maintained. The purpose of a secure cryptoprocessor is
  to act as the keystone of a security subsystem, eliminating the need to
  protect the rest of the subsystem with physical security measures.

* **[Trusted Platform Module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Platform_Module)** (**TPM**, also known as ISO/IEC 11889): an international standard
  for a secure cryptoprocessor, a dedicated microcontroller designed to
  secure hardware through integrated cryptographic keys.

* **[hardware security module (HSM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_security_module)**: a physical computing device that safeguards and manages
  digital keys for strong authentication and provides cryptoprocessing.

* **[Secure Element (SE)](https://www.justaskgemalto.com/en/what-is-a-secure-element/)**: a microprocessor chip which can store sensitive data and run
  secure apps such as payment. It acts as a vault, protecting what's inside
  the SE (applications and data) from malware attacks that are typical in
  the host (i.e. the device operating system).

* **[Dedicated Security Component](https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/communities/docs/cpp_dsc_v10d_DRAFT_20190501.docx)**: the combination of a
  hardware component and its controlling firmware dedicated to providing
  the encompassing platform with services for the provisioning, protection,
  and use of Security Data Objects (SDOs) consisting of keys, identities,
  attributes, and other types of Security Data Elements (SDEs).
