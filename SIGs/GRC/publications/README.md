## Confidential Computing Governance Patterns

These governance pattern documents aim to provide actionable guides for organizations to specify control objectives and procedures, as well as internal audit metrics, thereby facilitating the effective adoption of Confidential Computing (CC) technology. They are written in the pattern language<sup>[1]</sup>, following a common layout: a context for the pattern, a problem to solve within the context, forces that make the problem hard to solve, solutions that address those forces, and governance expectations.

## Target Audience

These documents are intended for compliance professionals, security architects, internal auditors, and other stakeholders involved in the adoption and oversight of Confidential Computing technologies within organizations.
