# Security Response Policy Guidelines

The [Project Proposal Template][project-submission-template.md] specifies that
a project should state what its security response policy is, if any, when
being submitted to the Confidential Computing Consortium.

Each CCC projects should have a written security response policy, but the
details may vary by project.  A written policy is not a prerequisite for
submitting a project to the CCC, but once accepted, projects are expected
to have some documented disclosure process.  A security response policy
should include an inbound disclosure process, and an outbound disclosure
process.  

## Inbound Disclosure Process

Questions to consider include:

1. How should a vulnerability be disclosed to the project?
2. Is anonymous disclosure permitted, and if so, how?

## Outbound Disclosure Process

Questions to consider include:

1. Who gets early notice of embargoed vulnerabilities?
2. Is the list of who gets early notice public or private?
3. How does one apply to get on the list of those who get early notice?
4. What is the process for vetting and approving such parties?
5. Are there any specific requirements that one must meet to get approved?
