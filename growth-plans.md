# Growth Plans

The [CCC Project Progression Policy](project-progression-policy.md) explains
that each [Incubation Stage](project-progression-policy.md#incubation-stage)
project accepted by the CCC must have a growth plan to track its progress
towards the [Graduation Stage](project-progression-policy.md#graduation-stage).

A "growth plan" is a written set of [growth goals](#growth-goals) and a
written set of actions intended to make forward progress towards those goals.
The growth plan does not need to have a fixed timeline.

The growth plan is reviewed when a project enters the Incubation or
Graduation Stage, and also as part of the project's
[Annual Review Process](project-progression-policy.md#iv-annual-review-process).

## Growth Goals

A project's growth goals are, at minimum, the CCC criteria for achieving 
Graduation Stage.

As a bit of history, the notion of project "incubation" and "graduation" were
[introduced](https://docs.openstack.org/project-team-guide/introduction.html)
by OpenStack and have since been followed by
[CNCF](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/process/graduation_criteria.adoc)
and other organizations, but the exact criteria vary by organization.

Objective criteria for graduation are preferred rather than subjective criteria (TODO: update the CCC Graduation Stage criteria to be objective).
Similarly, any additional growth goals should be objectively measurable.
