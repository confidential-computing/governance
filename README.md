## Definition
Confidential Computing is the protection of data in use by performing computation in a hardware-based Trusted Execution Environment.

## Mission Statement
The Confidential Computing Consortium brings together hardware vendors, cloud providers, and software developers to accelerate the adoption of Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) technologies and standards.

## Repository Maintenance
This repository is maintained by the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) which meets every two weeks.

The TAC has its own email list which is free to join. You can do so by by creating an account on the [CCC list server](https://lists.confidentialcomputing.io/g/main).

[Minutes of Technical Advisory Meetings](https://lists.confidentialcomputing.io/g/main/files/TAC/Meetings) are available to all those with an account on the CCC list server.

Meeting agendas are generally published to the TAC email list before the call, by the TAC chair. Details on how to join the [zoom call](https://lists.confidentialcomputing.io/g/tac/files/tac-zoom-info.txt) are also available. You may need to subscribe to the TAC list to view TAC-specific files.
