## I. Overview
This governance policy describes how an open source project can formally join the
Confidential Computing Consortium (hereafter the "Consortium") via the
[Project Proposal Process](). Projects that have joined the Consortium are
"Technical Projects". It describes the [Stages](#iii-stages---definitions--expectations)
a project may be admitted under and what the criteria and expectations are for a given
stage, as well as the acceptance criteria for a project to move from one stage to
another. It also describes the [Annual Review Process](#iv-annual-review-process)
through which those changes will be evaluated and made. 

Project progression - movement from one stage to another - allows projects to participate at the level that is most appropriate for them given where they are in their lifecycle. Regardless of stage, all Consortium projects benefit from a deepened alignment with existing projects, and access to mentorship, support, and Consortium resources.

For more information about how your project can benefit from Consortium membership and services, please see [TBD Document]().


## II. Project Proposal Process

### Introduction
This governance policy sets forth the proposal process for projects to be accepted into the Consortium. The process is the same for both existing projects which seek to move into the Consortium and new projects to be formed within the Consortium.

### Project Proposal Requirements
Projects must be formally proposed via GitHub. Project proposals submitted to the Consortium should provide the following information to the best of their ability:

* name of project
* project description (what it does, why it is valuable, origin and history)
* statement on alignment with Consortium charter's mission
* link to *current* Code of Conduct (if one is adopted already)
* sponsor from TAC, if identified (a sponsor helps mentor projects)
* project license 
* source control (GitHub by default)
* issue tracker (GitHub by default)
* external dependencies (including licenses)
* release methodology and mechanics
* names of initial committers, if different from those submitting proposal
* briefly describe the project's leadership team and decision-making process
* link to any documented governance practices
* preferred maturity level (see stages below)
* list of project's official communication channels (slack, irc, mailing lists)
* link to project's website 
* links to social media accounts
* existing financial sponsorship
* infrastructure needs or requests 

### Project Acceptance Process
* Projects are required to present their proposal at a TAC meeting. Technical Projects
  will specify an [OSI-approved license](https://opensource.org/licenses) for code contributions
  and/or specification license structure as appropriate (e.g., Joint Development Foundation projects).
* The TAC may ask for changes to bring the project into better alignment with the Confidential Computing Consortium (adding a governance document to a repository or adopting a Code of Conduct, for example).
* The project will need to make these changes in order to progress further.
* Projects are accepted or progress from level to level via a majority vote of TAC representatives present if quorum is reached or a majority of all TAC representatives if voting by email, unless a project is being accepted at or moved to either the Graduation or Emeritus stage, in which a vote of two-thirds of all TAC representatives is required.
* The proposal document will be finalized and a project charter prepared. This charter document must be included in the project's main repository.
* The TAC will determine the appropriate initial stage for the project. The project can apply for a different stage via the review process. 

## III. Stages - Definitions & Expectations 
Every Consortium project has an associated maturity level. Proposed projects should state their preferred maturity level.  There are four maturity levels under this Project Progression Policy:

* Sandbox - projects looking for a foundation with minimal initial resource requirements;
* Incubation - growing projects that targeting particular growth metrics and looking for resources from the Consortium; 
* Graduation - projects that have reached their growth goals and are now on a sustaining cycle of development, maintenance, and long-term support; and
* Emertius - projects that are approaching end-of-life.

Representatives of Technical Projects may attend TAC meetings and contribute work regardless of their stage. 

### Sandbox Stage
**Definition** 

The Sandbox stage is for projects that the TAC believes are, or have the potential to be, important to the ecosystem of Technical Projects or the ecosystem of the Consortium as a whole. They may be early-stage projects just getting started, or they may be long-established projects with minimal resource needs. The Sandbox stage provides a beneficial, neutral home for these projects in order to foster collaborative development and provide a path to deeper alignment with other Consortium projects via the graduation process.

**Examples**

1.	New projects that are designed to extend one or more Consortium projects with functionality or interoperability libraries. 
2.	Independent projects that fit within the Consortium mission and provide potential for a novel approach to existing functional areas (or are an attempt to meet an unfulfilled need).
3.	Projects commissioned or sanctioned by the Consortium.

**Expectations**

End users should evaluate Sandbox projects with care, as this stage does not set requirements for community size, governance, or production readiness. Sandbox projects will receive minimal support from the Consortium. Projects will be reviewed on an annual basis; they may also request a status review by submitting a report to the TAC.

**Acceptance Criteria**

To be considered for the Sandbox Stage, the project must meet the following requirements:
* 2 TAC representatives that will serve as sponsors to champion the project & provide mentorship as needed
* A presentation to at the meeting of the TAC

* Upon acceptance, Sandbox projects must list their status prominently on their website/README

### Incubation Stage
**Definition** 

The Incubation stage is for projects that are interested in reaching the Graduation stage, and have identified a growth plan for doing so. Incubation stage projects will receive mentorship from the TAC and are expected to actively develop their community of contributors, governance, project documentation, and other variables identified in the growth plan that factor into broad success and adoption.

In order to support their active development, projects in the Incubation stage have a higher level of access to Consortium resources as provided by the Governing Board of the Consortium. A project's progress toward its growth plan goals will be reviewed on a yearly basis, and the TAC may move a project to the Sandbox stage if progress on the plan drops off or stalls. 

**Examples**

1.	Projects that are on their way or very likely to become Graduation projects.
2.	Projects that have developed new growth targets or other community metrics for success.
3.	Projects that are looking to create a lifecycle plan (maintainership succession, contributor programs, version planning, etc.)
4.	Projects that need more active support from the Consortium or TAC mentorship in order to reach their goals. 

**Expectations**

Projects in the Incubation stage are generally expected to move out of the Incubation stage within two years. Depending on their growth plans, projects may cycle through Sandbox, Incubation, or Graduation stage as needed.  

**Acceptance Criteria**

To be considered for Incubation stage, the project must meet the Sandbox requirements as well as the following:

 * Development of a growth plan, to be done in conjunction with their project mentor(s) at the TAC.
 * Document that it is being used successfully in production by at least two independent end-user organizations which, in the TAC's judgement, are of adequate quality and scope.
 * Demonstrate a substantial, in the opinion of the TAC, ongoing flow of commits and merged contributions.
 * Demonstrate that the current level of community participation is sufficient to meet the goals outlined in the growth plan.
 * Since these metrics can vary significantly depending on the type, scope and size of a project, the TAC has final judgement over the level of activity that is adequate to meet these criteria.
 * Receive a two-thirds supermajority vote of the TAC to move to Incubation stage. 

### Graduation Stage
**Definition**

The Graduation stage is for projects that have reached their growth goals and are now on a sustaining cycle of development, maintenance, and long-term support. Graduation stage projects are used commonly in enterprise production environments and have large, well-established project communities.     

**Examples**

1.	Projects that have publicly documented release cycles and plans for Long Term Support ("LTS").
2.	Projects that have themselves become platforms for other projects.
3.	Projects that are able to attract a healthy number of committers on the basis of its production usefulness (not simply 'developer popularity').
4.	Projects that have several, high-profile or well known end-user implementations.

**Expectations**

Graduation stage projects are "TAC Projects" under the Funding Charter of the Consortium, and as such have a voting representative on the TAC. They are eligible to receive ongoing support from the Consortium as determined by the Governing Board, and are expected to cross promote the Consortium along with their activities.

**Acceptance Criteria**

To graduate from Sandbox or Incubation status, or for a new project to join as an Graduation project, a project must meet the Incubation stage criteria plus:

 * Have a defined governing body of at least 5 or more members (owners and core maintainers, or similar technical role), of which no more than 1/3 is affiliated with the same employer. In the case there are 5 governing members, 2 may be from the same employer. 
* Have a healthy number of committers from at least two organizations. A committer is defined as someone with the commit bit; i.e., someone who can accept contributions to some or all of the project.
* Adopt a Code of Conduct.
* Explicitly define a project governance and committer process. This is preferably laid out in a GOVERNANCE.md file and references a CONTRIBUTING.md and OWNERS.md file showing the current and emeritus committers.
* Have a public list of project adopters or users for at least the primary repo (e.g., ADOPTERS.md or logos on the project website).
* Other metrics as defined by the applying Project during the application process in cooperation with the TAC.
* Receive a supermajority vote from the TAC to move to Graduation stage. 

Projects can move directly from Sandbox to Graduation if they can demonstrate sufficient maturity and have met all requirements above. 


### Emeritus Stage
**Definition**

Emeritus projects are projects which the TAC or a project's maintainers feel have reached or are nearing end-of-life. Emeritus projects may have contributed to the ecosystem, but are not necessarily recommended for modern development as there may be more actively maintained choices. The Consortium appreciates the contributions of these projects and their communities, and the role they have played in moving the ecosystem forward. 

**Examples**

1.	Projects that are "complete" by the maintainers' standards.
2.	Projects that do not plan to release major versions in the future.

**Expectations**

Projects in this stage are not in active development. Their maintainers may infrequently monitor their repositories, and may only push updates to address security issues, if at all. Emeritus projects should clearly state their status and what any user or contributor should expect in terms of response or support. If there is an alternative project the maintainers recommend, it should be listed as well. The Consortium will continue to hold the IP and any trademarks and domains, but the project is not expected to draw on Consortium resources. 

**Acceptance Criteria**

Projects may be granted Emeritus status via a vote of two-thirds of the representatives of the TAC.


## IV. Annual Review Process

The TAC shall develop an annual review process to determine whether projects are in the stage that accurately reflects their needs and goals.
