# Diversity and Inclusion Policy Guidelines

## Intro
The Confidential Computing Consortium is a community focused on open source
licensed projects securing DATA IN USE & accelerating the adoption of
confidential computing through open collaboration.

Every member is welcome; every project meeting our criteria is welcome. 
We are a transparent, collaborative community.

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation
in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone.


## Policies
The [Project Proposal Template](project-submission-template.md) specifies that
a project must have a Code of Conduct to be submitted to the Confidential
Computing Consortium.

The [Project Progression Policy](project-submission-template.md) specifies
additional community characteristics for a project to demonstrate for each
stage.

Each project is expected to develop an inclusive and diverse community.
The means and specific goals may vary by project. The project's mentor is one
resource available to assist in this area. A short list of additional resources
and recommendations is provided in this document as an aid to projects.
Projects are welcome to utilize additional resources as fit the needs of their
communities.


## Resources

### Training
Maintainers are recommended to take the Linux Foundation course: 
[Inclusive Open Source Community Orientation](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/inclusive-open-source-community-orientation-lfc102/) 

Any contributor who may present in a CCC sponsored forum is recommended (and in
some cases may be required) to take the Linux Foundation course:
[Inclusive Speaker Orientation](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/resources/free-courses/inclusive-speaker-orientation/)

### Inclusive writing style guides
An open source best practice is to document style requirements. This makes it
easier for new contributors to conform to community norms without guessing and
reduces unproductive practices like "bike shedding". Example style guides
include:

### Internships
The CCC TAC has [committed to support interns](./project-progression-policy.md#benefits-of-being-a-recognized-consortium-project)
 for CCC projects that commit to the list of "Mentor Responsibilities" on the [Outreachy mentor page](https://www.outreachy.org/mentor/).
