## Confidential Computing Consortium Travel Expense Policy


The Confidential Computing Consortiumâ€™s Travel Budgets are intended to enable CCC Technical Project developers and community members to attend events that they would otherwise be unable to attend due to lack of funding. If an individual works for a company that has the ability to fund the travel, the TAC expects the individual to seek funding from their company first, to save funds for those who need it. The goal is to try to use the CCC funds to assist as many people as possible.

In order to maximize spend, travel fund assistance may only be used for:

* Coach airfare, train or bus tickets 
* Accommodations (Dates of the event plus one night prior are eligible for reimbursement)
* Ground transportation to/from the airport, train or bus station

**NOTE:** Funds may not be used for miscellaneous travel expenses including food, visa costs, non airport, train station or bus station transportation, baggage fees, etc. Generally, registration can be reimbursed if the attendee is speaking on behalf of the CCC, a CCC Technical Project, or staffing a CCC booth at a sponsored event.


#### TAC and Outreach Committee Reimbursement Process

1. Estimate travel expenses based on the guidelines listed above.
2. Submit travel estimate to your committee and operations@confidentialcomputing.io with the reasons for travel (presenting, staffing a booth, etc.)
3. Get approval for the travel from the committee and/or from the Executive Director or the Technical Community Architect.
4. Purchase the travel and attend the event.
5. Provide a trip report shared with your committee. Preferably, also provide pictures and video of the event for use on social media.
6. Once you have completed the travel and paid the expenses, fill out and submit the Linux Foundation expense report and all receipts to operations@confidentialcomputing.io. Contact operations@confidentialcomputing.io for the expense report template and for any questions.

**NOTE:** The Linux Foundation cannot purchase any travel, only reimburse the expense afterwards.
