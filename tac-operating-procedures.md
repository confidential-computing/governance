# TAC Operating Procedures

This document outlines the operational policies adopted by the Technical Advisory Council (TAC) to
ensure efficient governance and decision-making. These policies are adopted by consensus of the TAC
and serve as standing rules in addition to the [Technical Charter](TECHNICAL_CHARTER.md).

## 1. Voting Member Attendance and Quorum

To ensure the TAC maintains the ability to conduct official business and reach quorum, Voting
Members are expected to maintain consistent attendance.

### 1.1. Inactive Status

A Voting Member shall be deemed "Inactive" for the purposes of quorum
calculation if either of the following conditions is met:

* **Consecutive Absence:** The member is absent for **three (3)** consecutive meetings.
* **Quarterly Attendance:** The member is absent for **fifty percent (50%)** or more of the meetings
  held within a calendar quarter.

### 1.2. Effect on Quorum Members deemed "Inactive":

* Retain their seat on the TAC.
* May fully participate in discussions and meetings.
* **Are excluded** from the total number of Voting Members used to calculate the quorum requirement.
* Are ineligible to vote until their status is restored.

### 1.3. Reinstatement of Voting Rights

An Inactive Member may automatically restore their status to "Active" (and thus count toward quorum)
by attending **two (2)** consecutive TAC meetings. Voting rights are reinstated effective at the
start of the third consecutive meeting attended.

### 1.4. Leave of Absence
A Voting Member may request a voluntary "Leave of Absence" by notifying the TAC Chair in writing.
During this period, the member is not counted toward the quorum denominator. They may return to
Active status immediately upon notifying the Chair of their return.
Ideally, companies should name an alternate Voting Member to attend during the absence.
