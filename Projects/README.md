## Certifier Framework For Confidential Computing 

The Certifier Framework for Confidential Computing consists of a client API called the Certifier API and server-based policy evaluation server called the Certifier Service.

The Certifier API greatly simplifies and unifies programming and operations support for multi-vendor Confidential Computing platforms by providing simple client trust management, including attestation evaluation, secure storage, platform initialization, secret sharing, secure channels and other services.

## COCONUT-SVSM

The COCONUT-SVSM is an implementation of a Secure VM Service Module for confidential
computing virtual machines (CVMs). It runs within the TCB of the CVM and aims to support three
operational modes:

1. Service Module Mode
1. Paravisor Mode
1. Service VM Mode
   
With its ability to provide secure services, the COCONUT-SVSM aims to become a platform to
execute host hypervisor services within the trusted context of the CVM and reducing the interface
between the hypervisor and the CVM OS. It acts as a proxy between the hypervisor and the CVM
OS to reduce the need to harden the CVM OS from malicious hypervisor input.

## Gramine

<img height="100" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/confidential-computing/artwork/main/gramine/gramine-logo-horizontal-color.svg">

Gramine is a library OS, similar to a unikernel. Compared to running a complete guest OS in a virtual machine (VM), Gramine is much lighter weight. A particular use case for Gramine is Intel® Software Guard Extensions (Intel® SGX), where applications do not work out-of-the-box. Gramine solves this problem, with the added security benefits. Gramine can serve as a compatibility layer on other platforms.
