# Technical Advisory Council GitHub Process

The process that is currently in use by the TAC is as follows:

1. The chair checks the issues and pull requests (PRs) to decide which, if any,
   should be on the next meeting agenda.
2. All [TAC members](CODEOWNERS) (not just the voting members) should have sent their
   github ids to the [chair and the Acting Secretary](tac-composition.md) so any
   TAC PRs can have all TAC members as reviewers.
3. Once PRs are approved by two TAC members (potentially including the author,
   if the author is a TAC member and doesn't indicate lack of explicit
   approval) with no change requests from any other reviewers,
   then the "time bomb" label is added with a timeout of 1 week.
4. A PR is merged once it's been open for at least a week and either
   the "time bomb" has been there for a week, or two TAC members other
   than the author approve, with no change requests from any other reviewers.
