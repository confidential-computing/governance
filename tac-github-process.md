# Technical Advisory Council GitHub Process

The process that is currently in use by the TAC is as follows:

1. The chair checks the issues and pull requests (PRs) to decide which, if any,
   should be on the next meeting agenda.
2. All TAC members (not just the voting members) should have sent their
   github ids to the chair and the Acting Secretary (Stephano) so any
   TAC PRs can have all TAC members as reviewers.
3. Once PRs are approved by two TAC members (potentially including the author,
   if the author is a TAC member and doesn't indicate lack of explicit
   approval) with no change requests from any other reviewers,
   then the "time bomb" label is added with a timeout of 1 week.
4. A PR is merged once it's been open for at least a week and either
   the "time bomb" has been there for a week, or two TAC members other
   than the author approve, with no change requests from any other reviewers.
