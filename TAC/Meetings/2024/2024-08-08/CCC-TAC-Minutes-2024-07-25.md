## 2024 CCC TAC Objectives

DM introduced the [CCC objective](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l5ekwOC0KhVwmBebaR9WHlFoCrM6mQEQolMo84-4kkk/edit) of facilitating collaboration for CCC projects. Catherine Zhang (CZ) reviewed the specific KRs supporting this objective. DM asked if all this work would be done within COCONUT-SVSM, CZ replied that they believed there were some kernel dependencies that would need to be upsreamed. Discussion ensued. 

Ben Sternthal (BS) explained his rationale for placing the Meta KR under the collaboration objective. It was agreed that Ben would move the 2023 objective, which focused on expanding the project portfolio, and would organize the Meta KR under it.

DM suggested that bootstrapping the creation of the Kernel SIG should be listed as a KR and added this to the document.

## Open Platform For Enterprise AI

CZ also stated that the documentation needed improvement. CZ stated that Google supported the project becoming part of CCC.
