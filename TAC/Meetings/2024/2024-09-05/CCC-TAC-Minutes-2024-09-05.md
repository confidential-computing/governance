## Attestation Terminology

Mike Bursell (MB) introduced Attestation & AVS (Attestation Verification Services) and discussed the topics that came out of the Attestations Business models document. He discusses the way CCC should talk about attestation and remote attestation. He proposed that definitions need to be calcified. Chandra Nelogal (CN) agreed that the term remote could mean several different things and continued to explain his perspective on the topic. Nathaniel McCallum (NM) said that Attestation is becoming a loaded term with different definitions in various industries. Further discussion ensued.

DM suggested that the work should be broken down into work packages that could be addressed through working groups. Catherine Zhang ask if the work packages would be addressed by existing working groups or new groups. MB proposed that a portion of the TAC meeting could be set apart for that on a bi-weekly basis. DM proposed that the TAC could assign questions and work to the existing working groups to be addressed. DM asked meeting participants to communicate on the topic through the TAC Slack channel and mailing list and it would be further discussed in the next meeting.

## Super Protocol Tech Talk
