## TAC 2025 Objectives

Paul Howard (PH) seeked clarification on the distinction between objectives and key results (OKR) and project-specific growth plans.
Clarifications:
- Growth objectives for individual projects should not be included in the OKR document but developed as separate growth plans. Growth plans aim to help projects meet maturity criteria outlined in governance documents.
- Storage and Access: There is no standardized repository or template for growth plans. Historically, the system was simplified, and growth plans are now guided by adoption and progression metrics.

Requirements:
- Establish a shared location or template for project growth plans to ensure uniformity and accessibility. 
- Review governance criteria to align growth plans with maturity stages.
 - Volunteers to propose next steps for developing templates or repositories for growth plans

YM emphasized on the community health and growth. Fritz Alder also emphasized on the community health and growth and to combine all the objectives into one community objective. Discussion ensued.
PH volunteered for creation of a project plan. Catherine Zhang (CZ) confirmed her volenteership for the Kernel related activities.
Nathaniel explained about the COCO project.
