## 2024 CCC TAC Objectives

DM introduced the TAC goals document. Mingshen Sun (MS) reviewed the two objectives that they are aiming to complete by the end of the year. Discussion ensued. DM asked if the CCC should make hardware available to students. JVB agreed and thought this would be valuable in academia especially for small research groups. JVB stressed that there should be no strings attached e.g. NDA.  There was discussion around how we could either use budget or shop around for free credits.

Ben Sternthal (BS) suggested that the group compile a list of asks and potential companies to approach for free credits. BS also mentioned the possibility of offering co-marketing opportunities to partners.

## Budget

DM asked committee members to start thinking about what they would like to see in the 2025 budget as that would be discussed in the upcoming TAC meetings.
