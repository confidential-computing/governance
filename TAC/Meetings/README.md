# Confidential Computing Consortium TAC meetings

The CCC Technical Advisory Council (TAC) meets every other Thursday for two hours. All members of our project community are welcome to join and participate.

Decisions are generally made by consensus, except for those which explicitly require a vote (meeting minutes, project acceptance, etc.). Each [Premier member of the CCC](https://confidentialcomputing.io/members/) designates a voting representative. Votes can either happen live in meetings where at least 50% of voting members are present, or asynchronously.
