## Meeting Minute Approval

Dan Middleton (DM) reviewed the minutes of the last meeting and stated that we would experiment with approving minutes via Github.
Going forward meeting minutes will be approved according to the GB agreement where a PR can be merged with two approvals.


## Scaling Project Mentors 

DM spoke to three options for scaling project mentorship. The first option is assigning voting members round-robin style. The second option would be to stop doing this entirely. The third option would be looking for common topic areas among the projects, and TAC folks volunteer to be mentors for those topics. 

Chris Ramming (CR) expressed support for option three and stated that one of the most important mentorship responsibilities for a mentor is finding connections between projects. 

Yash Mankad (YM) asked if any mentors on the call could give feedback on their experience but none was in the meeting.

Catalin Sandu (CS) raised concerns about time commitments that members might not be able to manage. DM responded that member involvement with the project is important.

Sal Kimmich (SM) Pointed to developer inventions and the benefits to the communities where mentorship support project improvements.Process patch as opposed to code patches.

Create Linux Kernel SIG #196Chris Ramming raises the topic of projectâ€™s Github repository management and management of repos under a single org. - CR would create an Github issue to outline this.
