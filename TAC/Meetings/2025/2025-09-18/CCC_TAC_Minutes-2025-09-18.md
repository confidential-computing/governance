## Annual Project review Veraison by Simon Frost
Simon Frost (SF) presented the annual project review of Veraison, provided an update on the technical progress of the project, highlighting the completion of Intel TDX support, improvements in native service deployment, and the addition of an AWS service deployment example. SF added that the project has seen increased use of Rust alongside Golang, and new implementations of various RATS standards. Community engagement has grown, with 51 individual contributors and 21 organizations, and live deployments are in place at Oracle and Linaro. Mike Bursell suggested considering project graduation to the next stage in the LF lifecycle due to production deployments, and discussed the importance of threat modeling and compliance with the Cyber Resilience Act for EU deployments.

## 2025 TAC Objective Review:  Arm’s Ecosystem OKR
 Paul Howard presented the Arm’s Ecosystem OKR.


* Research Fund proposal for academic projects
YM mentioned that Mingshen Sun (MS) from TikTok has proposed a funding mechanism for academic work. MS presented plans to establish an academic research fund following the eBPF Foundation model, with a goal to support confidential computing research and foster adoption. The TAC group discussed next steps including forming a program committee, reducing the broad list of research topics, and establishing clear selection criteria focused on impact rather than quantity of applications. 
Mike Bursell clarified the proposal that no more than one person per company/group of companies should serve on the programme committee.
Mona Vij, Mike Bursell, Dan Middleton, Caroline Perez-Vargas, Fritz Alder, Mingshen Sun & SIG Chairs volunteered to be potential program committee. MS also provided clarity about the research fund program & mentorship program. [Document link](./Confidential%20Computing%20Consortium%20Research%20Fund.pdf)
