RK gave an update on the meeting with the Attestation SIG leaders on the moving of the CCC-Attestation Repositories to the main CCC org. RK would create a document to propose a migration strategy and emphasized that moving the repos should rather be done slowly to ensure it is done correctly.

DM  briefly reviewed the previous meeting topics, including SPDM tools project updates, islet mentorship, and moving Veracruz to Emeritus status. DM mentioned that guidelines for tech talks have been added to the governance repo.

## Annual Project Review: Coconut_SVSM 
Joerg Roedel presented the annual project review for the Coconut_SVSM project and answered questions about the project.

## Glossary
DM discussed the CCC Glossary repo and pointed out that work was started but stalled. He asked if there is anyone in the committee that would be interested in picking up the responsibility for coordination of the effort. AF gave some context on the background for working with CSA on the development of a CC glossary. He asked if anyone knows if CSA is using the glossary or links to it. MN said he had frequent contact with CSA and could find out. He further stated that the CC Glossary should be updated and kept up to date as is important for the CC space. MN committed to work on terminology that intersects with the work he is doing.
Discussion ensured on ways to get broader input from members companies and the community as well as review of pull requests by the TAC.

## Review of Patterns docs PR
DM discussed the open PR [Add cover page for patterns docs #308](https://github.com/confidential-computing/governance/pull/308) asked for review and approval of the PR if deemed ready to merge. No objections were raised and the PR merged during the meeting.
