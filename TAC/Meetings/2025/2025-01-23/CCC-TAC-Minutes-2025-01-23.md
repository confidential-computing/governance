## Discussion:   Workload Identity 
Mark Novak (MN) led the discussion on the workload identity. MN shared that he has already shared the details in the email (for reference). MN proposed to have dedicated people from the TAC members (for example having a separate SIG) for the workload identity for the success of Confidential Computing in the marketplace. Alec Fernandez (AF) appreciated the use cases shared in a link by YM. 
MN emphasized that a stronger collaboration is required. MB mentioned discussing this topic in the GB meeting too. 

## Project Proposal: OpenVMM 
Caroline Perez-Vargas (CPV) presented the OpenVMM project to the TAC members. 
Members of the TAC asked clarifying questions about the project, which CPV answered.


DM asked about the MS Open Source Code of Conduct. CPV shall look into the differences between the Contributor Covenent and the Microsoft code of conduct 

DM asked about copy left implications. CPV said they do not foresee implications.

MB asked about the existing community and how the project would extend the community and if there are other contributors then MS? CPV the project already had external contributions, however most is still done by MS. They are all looking at ways to socialize the project. Looking for more partners and having public meetings. They are also looking for guidance from the CCC on how to reach these goals.

DM ask if their is a way for contributors to become maintainers and if the project are interested in external maintainers. CPV said they plan for it, but would develop the plan with the community rather than use their own internal arrangements.


The motion to accept the project proposal was made by Alec Fernandez and seconded by  Paul Howard.

* Paul Howard - ARM - Yes
* Intel - Dan Middleton (TAC chair) - Yes
