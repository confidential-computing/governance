## TAC discussion: Research Fund proposal for academic projects
DM requested to get the volunteers for a committee to review research fund proposals.The current volunteers included Fritz Alder, Mingshen Sun, Mona Vij, Mike Bursell, and Caroline Perez-Vargas. The committee will help evaluate academic research proposals related to confidential computing, with funding initially coming from TikTok.

## Budget proposal for 2026
DM gave a brief overview of the budget proposal for 2026:  DM explained flat budget from 2025 to 2026 for regular expenses.
Yash Mankad asked questions about mentorship program funding (currently showing $0 spent). RK mentioned that he is looking into the budget options for this.
There was a discussion about considering two major potential expenditures: 
- Increasing budget for a Technical Community Architect position 
- A security audit for the SPDM project 

Two potential big-ticket items identified: 
- Technical Community Architect (considering doubling budget or scrapping) 
- SPDM security audit ((estimated at around $70K))

The TAC members also discussed whether the SPDM security security audit is worth the cost and how to potentially scope it better.
The committee also discussed the SPDM protocol and implementation (SPDMRS), including its usage in industry and the potential value of a security audit. Members were asked to check if their companies use SPDMRS and might contribute to funding the audit.

## Trustless Attestation Verification in Confidential 
Donghang Lu (DL) presented on "Trustless Attestation Verification":
An anonymous attestation project using zero-knowledge proofs
Open-sourced last year
TikTok is considering donating it as a CCC project and integrating with Veraison
DL added:
The project uses zero-knowledge proofs to make attestation verification services trustless.
It addresses trust boundary issues in cloud-based attestation verification services.
