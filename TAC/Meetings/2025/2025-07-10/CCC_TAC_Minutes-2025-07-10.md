## Annual Project Review: OE SDK by Radhika Jandhyala
Radhika Jandhyala(RJ)  presented the annual project review of the OE SDK project.Document [link](./Open%20Enclave%20SDK%20Annual%20Project%20Review%202025-CCC.docx.pdf)
Alec Fernandez (AF) and MB agreed to have an offline conversation about principles and guidance for making hard choices regarding breaking changes that increase security, possibly bringing their findings back to the TAC.

There was a Q&A session after Radhika's presentation, discussing:  
  - Hardware support (SGX and TDX attestation)
  - The composition of contributors and governance
  - Challenges with transitioning to newer versions of OpenSSL
  - Suggestions for applying the Open SSF baseline security practices


## TAC Maintenance 
Glossary: The discussion touched on the CCC glossary. AF mentioned there were no significant updates due to recent cancellations of meetings with the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA). AF will follow up with the CSA to determine if any deep links to the glossary have made it into their Cloud Controls Matrix. If so, existing links must remain, but the project might be archived (links still work, but no new pushes) or "graduated" (similar to retiring). 
DM encouraged the community members to review existing definitions for defects or critical missing terms and propose fixes or additions if needed.

## Topic Schedule 2025  
DM reviewed the schedule for the upcoming weeks.

## Any Other Business / Topic Schedule 2025

Next meeting July 24, 2025. The meeting was adjourned by DM at 07:45 am PT
