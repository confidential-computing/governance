## Project proposal: dstack by Zhou Shelven
Zhou Shelven (ZS)  presented the dstack project proposal to the meeting. No votes were taken as the meeting lacked quorum, but the project will likely be considered for a vote in a future meeting. The questions were very well answered. DM encouraged all the TAC members to submit any questions or objections regarding the proposal to the mailing list within one week. If no significant questions or objections are raised on the mailing list by that time, he will proceed with initiating the formal vote over email.
